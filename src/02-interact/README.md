# Interacting with the screen
Dowload and install our [sample application].

We have a black screen on our app.

<p align="center">
<img style="width: 50%" title="" src="assets/screenshot-black.png">
</p>

Uhm, not very useful.

We need the control of the screen. We can achieve this using `android_glue`, provided by [android-rs-glue].
